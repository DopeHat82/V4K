              <p>Welcome to our blog! Vanilla4Kink was created with hopes of helping couples who are sexual opposites… mainly when one person is Vanilla and the other is 
                  Kinky. My blog is mainly focused on the Vanilla partner and how they can help to bridge different levels of intimacy gaps with their more advanced “Kinky” 
                  partners. This is a topic that I have struggled to overcome with my spouse for many many years and I hope others can stand on my shoulders and learn from my 
                  experiences to achieve not only a better relationship but a better understanding of what is likely going through their kinky spouses head. 
              <span id="AboutReadMore" style="display:none;">
                    When a couple is on different levels in the bedroom it can create other gaps in their relationship that they may not even see- especially as your relationship 
                    evolves. As an example, picture your relationship as a train with one engine in front and one engine in the back and a bunch of fright cars in between them. If 
                    the engines do not move in unison then the train could pull apart the freight cars and even damage the engines. The trains are you and your spouse and the 
                    freight cars are your families and the life you built together. In my case where my wife is the Vanilla and I am the Kink, I found that other parts of our 
                    relationship suffered as a result of our sexual differences. She craved a closeness that I could not fully deliver on because I did not feel close to her due 
                    to our differences in the bedroom. So cuddling and closeness (things I crave too) fell by the wayside because we experience it different ways. As a Kink, my 
                    idea of closeness in a relationship is someone who I can openly fulfill desires for and in turn, have my desires fulfilled without judgment- just for the sake 
                    of seeing them enjoy the ecstasy we provide each other. Everything else from the cuddling to the sweet talk comes naturally to me in that scenario. As a 
                    Vanilla, she wanted the cuddling, sweet talk, and random acts of passion which comes very naturally to her. In the beginning of our relationship (during that 
                    honeymoon phase) we, of course, put up our fronts to meet each other needs as we were in love. But since our relationship evolved at two completely separate 
                    paces in two completely separate ways we started drifting apart. Instead of being one natural force of nature together we became to completely separate forces 
                    that required a lot of sacrifice to each other to just remain cohabitants… even though we stilled loved each other immensely. So why Vanilla4Kink as oppose to 
                    Kink4Vanilla? While bridging the gap does require taking action from both sides so as to keep the train at pace my wife and I have found that the key to our 
                    relationship was getting her to bring things to the table.. the bedroom that is. Mainly because we both want what she wants which is stability in a close and 
                    loving relationship… I just had different needs that had to be met in order for me to reciprocate it autonomously, naturally. I can also tell you from 
                    experience, that it is easier for a Kink a to satisfy the needs of a Vanilla… but the problem there is after a while it becomes really one-sided and the Kink 
                    will find themselves forcing it upon themselves as they will undoubtedly question what they want/need and how to get it. If any of the above is relatable to 
                    you, I hope my findings here will help you. I have seen so many relationships fail due to couples speaking different intimate dialects when they could have 
                    genuinely been happy with each other if they had just found that common ground. The sources for the information I blog about come from my own experiences, my 
                    networks experiences, and a variety of psychologists and psychology resources. I am not Ph.D. or licensed therapist.
