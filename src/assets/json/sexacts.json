        "description": "<p>As far as fetishes go, Water Sports is generally considered pretty tame. It has widely been associated with domination and submission- but as you browse the internet you'll find that is not typically the case. The Water Sports fetish varies significantly from person to person each often having very specific attractions to it. One person may like the role change in both domination and submission when performing the act and another may just simply crave the smell and or taste their partners urine and pheromones because it comes from their partner who they love dearly and they want to experience them deeper than typical intercourse. Urine in the natural world is often a potent attractant. For example, male deer (bucks) are attracted to doe urine and follow traces of it for miles and miles when pursuing a mate. At any rate, here are a few good tips for Vanilla boys and girls to consider when engaging in this sex act.   </p>",
        "tryThis": "<strong>What beginners should know:</strong><br /><ul><li>Drink a lot of water. You want your urine to be as diluted as possible. And just like your body and vaginal or seminal fluids taste and scent, diet plays a key role here. Wine (alcohol), black tea, and fruit juices will also helps keep your scent clean and pheromonious for your Kink. You’ll want to drink any of the above in a greater quantity just prior. </li><li>Make sure your bladder is full and you really have to go before performing the act. This will help ensure dillution. If you have to force yourself to go you are most likely not ready and your urine is not dilluted yet.</li><li>Try and go at least once after you've consumed a lot of fluids before performing the act. This will help ensure dillution. </li><li>Avoid performing this act in the mornings. Let’s face it- most of us do not smell great right away in the AM. Plus beverages like coffee will ruin your scent. Best to wait until evening.</li><li>Stay away from eating too much meat and potent veggies on the day you wish to part take in watersports. This will overpower your natural scent and likely be a turn off. </li><li>The shower is always a good place to start. Easy clean up. (Plus its fun to shower together)</li><li>If you want to start light. Try just peeing on you Kinks leg in the shower.</li><li>Getting your Kink to softly encourage with words is always nice and can make the experience better for both parties.</li><li>Deep breathes. Peeing in front of or on someone might give you a little stage fright at first. Be patient and calm. </li></ul><strong>Always remember that to try just once and never again is not really trying. Sometimes you have to work to find your groove and enjoyment. </strong>",

        "description": "<p>Anal stimulation and anal sex has long time been a source of pleasure for many couples.  The anus is just packed with sensitive nerve endings that can be quite pleasurable when stimulated. Thoughts or comments like its painful or dirty come from people who have not educated themselves or taken time to use common sense. But these outcomes can easily be prevented with a little patients, know how, and mindfulness of your body. A good expirence with anal sex is not very hard to achieve.  In fact, your pudendal nerve (a nerve that bisects the clitoris/penis that goes all the way to the anus) can provide sensations similiar to gential stimulation. It basically like getting off from the other side. The truth is incorporating the anus into your sex life can be clean, pleasurable, and AMAZING!! And there are many couples out there that will attest to this. In some cases, anal sex can even be preferred over conventional sex by women and men alike.</p>",
        "tryThis": "<strong>What beginners should know:</strong><br /><ul><li>Try it on your own first and find your threshold. You know your body better that your partner and trying to figure this out on the fly during your first time could cause pain and alot of unesscary anxiety.</li><li>Make sure your body is relaxed. A glass or two of wine or favorite alchol can certainly help achieve this.</li><li>Lube, lube, lube! Use alot of lubrication. Your body does not naturally produce there... plus would you want it too?</li><li>Start out very small. A finger is usually a good plave to start.</li><li>For the first time with your partner, be sure to set a depth... meaning they should not go all the way in. Ease into it very slowly.</li><li>It will likely feel better when gential stimulation is also occuring. In fact, stimulating both the anus and your gentials can create an enhanced arousal.</li><li>Make sure you are clean. Although the rectum does not typically hold or contain fecal material- there are a variety of methods that ensure that yours is clean. From anal douches to lube like washes, you have plenty of options. </li></ul><strong>Always remember that to try just once and never again is not really trying.

Attraction to fluid bonding is in almost every one of us to some extent with varying levels of obsession. Taking a lesson from porn and porn enthusiasts, tags and titles like ''dripping'' and  ''taste me'' kinda says it all.

Its often a prerequisite for a vast majority of women and some men too. So why? That's where I poo from...why would I want that licked? Well as mentioned in the introduction to anal sex, there are so many nerve endings in the anus as well as the [nerve] that is connected with your ''pleasure center''. To simplify, your tongue (or lovers tongue) is far more gentle than any other body part- making it almost perfect for stimulating your anus- which is very sensitive. In fact, prior anal sex, it is one of the best methods of preparing your anus for penetration. The key here is to be clean and let your inhibitions go. Your kink is likely no stranger to this sex act any way. In fact, the ''sexual animal'' in most males won't find it offensive or hard to perform. Its a private part of you and playing with it with their mouths or tongue will undoubtedly delight them or turn them on. There are no special rules to analingus as there are no real special rules to any oral sex. If it feels good- then its done right. </p>",

Your kinks jaw will likely drop as he/she perform the act on you. And, with your inhibitions gone, will enjoy a very pleasurable sensation.

The fact is there are tons of people, both men and women, who enjoy feet play and find it very erotic. Here are a couple reasons/comments we've compiled from sample of contributors and members:<ul><li>''Women's feet and toes have a sensual appeal to me. They are decorated with polish and sometimes jewelery and often appeal to me and gentle and graceful.</li><li>''Women's feet are attractive to me since they are so different from mens feet. There is an almost delicate quality to them.'' </li><li>''Foot massages are like a gateway to my vagina. Something about a masculine hand rubbing my feet for me just turns me on.'' </li><li>Feet play kinda tickles my feet in a sensual way.

It can also create anxiety in couples who have been together a long time and are just getting into it. Why? we'll from our sample of people the main reason it was hard to get into was simply because they knew what their partners wanted already and when you're in aloving relationship- taking a different role means you are either going to be controlling your partner for you pleasure or he or she will be controlling you for theirs. There is one big plus here, though. Loving couples in long standing relationships have trust... and trust is certainly a prerequisite for dominance or submission. <br /><br /> So why is it fun? Like roleplaying, its fun because you get to act out a different role. Whether its your deepest desire to be dominate... or your partner just wants you too. Getting out of the norm can be exciting. <br /><br />Couples who enjoy dom/sub relationships often enjoy things like restraint, the dom making sexual demands on the sub, humilaty, and everything in between. Some couples have found they really like their roles and  run their relationship this way as an extension of their sex life... or at least whenever they are in private.
